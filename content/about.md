My name is Jiarui Li. I work at the intersection of **AI security**, **applied cryptography**, and **practical systems**, with a focus on **LLM privacy** and **trustworthy AI**.

This blog is where I turn reading and prototyping into structured notes—problem definitions, threat models, techniques, and what I think still doesn’t work.

**Topics I write about**
- Prompt privacy & semantic leakage in LLM applications
- Threat modeling for enterprise LLM deployments
- Secure inference / privacy-preserving ML systems
- Integrity in federated learning
